# BillSplit

This repo is for my Mobile Computing Assignment 1 project.

BillSplit is a simple utility app that allows users to split the cost of a bill between X number of people, such as when a group of people share a meal together.

BillSplit also has tip calculating functionality, allowing users to select how much of a tip they would like to leave. BillSplit takes this into account and includes it in the cost per-person.
